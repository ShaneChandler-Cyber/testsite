# Key Projects

## Project 1: Home Network SIEM Setup

I built a secure home network with Access Control Lists (ACLs) and integrated it with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Security Onion. This setup involved configuring firewalls and creating custom detection rules to monitor and analyze real-time network traffic, helping to detect and respond to potential threats.

## Project 2: ELK Stack Deployment

Successfully configured and deployed the ELK Stack on a Linux Virtual Machine (VM). This included setting up Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log collection, processing, and visualization. The system helps in analyzing security logs from various sources and provides actionable insights.

## Project 3: Cybersecurity Lab Setup (Ongoing)

Currently working on a cybersecurity lab to simulate real-world scenarios involving penetration testing, threat detection, and mitigation using tools such as Nessus, Metasploit, and Kali Linux. The goal is to sharpen my skills in vulnerability scanning and ethical hacking as I prepare for the OSCP and Pentest+ certifications.

## Roadmap

My professional journey is focused on becoming a SOC Analyst and later advancing into a cyber threat intelligence role. I'm actively building skills and planning to take key certifications such as OSCP, Pentest+, and CISSP to bolster my technical expertise.

### 1. Foundational Knowledge and Skills Development
- **IT Proficiency**: Leverage my nearly 15 years of IT experience to solidify my foundational knowledge in systems and network administration, which is essential for a SOC Analyst role.
- **Core Security Concepts**: Deepen my understanding of cybersecurity principles, including:
  - **Risk Management**: Learn to identify, assess, and mitigate security risks.
  - **Incident Response**: Familiarize myself with incident response frameworks and best practices.
  - **Threat Modeling**: Understand how to identify potential threats to systems and networks.

### 2. Certifications and Training
- **CompTIA Security+**: Complete this certification to validate my foundational cybersecurity knowledge.
- **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)**: Plan and prepare for this hands-on certification, focusing on penetration testing and ethical hacking skills.
- **Pentest+**: Pursue this certification to demonstrate my proficiency in penetration testing and vulnerability management.
- **CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional)**: Begin studying for this advanced certification to solidify my knowledge in security management and governance.

### 3. Hands-On Experience and Practical Application
- **Set Up a Home Lab**: Create a home lab environment to practice skills using tools like(in progress):
  - **Python** Proficiency in Python for automation, application development, and artificial intelligence. 
  - **ELK Stack** for logging and monitoring.
  - **Security Onion** for intrusion detection and monitoring.
  - **Wazuh** Expertise in Wazuh for security monitoring, threat detection, and compliance management.
- **Participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) Competitions**: Engage in CTFs to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and enhance problem-solving skills.
- **Freelance or Volunteer Work**: Seek opportunities to gain practical experience through freelance projects or volunteer work in cybersecurity roles.

### 4. Networking and Professional Development
- **Join Professional Associations**: Become a member of organizations such as (ISC)Â² or ISACA to connect with professionals in the field and access resources.
- **Attend Cybersecurity Conferences**: Participate in conferences and workshops to stay updated on industry trends and network with peers.
- **Engage in Online Communities**: Join forums and discussion groups (e.g., LinkedIn, Reddit) to learn from others and share my knowledge.


### 5. Career Advancement Towards Cyber Threat Intelligence
- **Understand Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Research and familiarize myself with concepts related to threat intelligence, including:
  - **Threat Actors**: Learn about different types of threat actors and their tactics.
  - **Intelligence Analysis**: Develop skills in analyzing and interpreting threat data.
- **Certifications for Cyber Threat Intelligence**: Explore certifications like:
  - **Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (CTIA)** to enhance my understanding and credibility in this area.
- **Seek Threat Intelligence Roles**: Once established as a SOC Analyst, look for internal opportunities or external roles focused on threat intelligence to transition into this field.

### 7. Long-Term Goals and Continuous Learning
- **Develop a Specialization**: Identify a specific area within cyber threat intelligence that I am passionate about and pursue additional training or certifications in that area.
- **Mentorship**: Find a mentor within the cybersecurity field who can provide guidance and advice as I progress in my career.
- **Stay Current with Industry Trends**: Regularly read cybersecurity blogs, white papers, and reports to stay informed about emerging threats and technologies.
